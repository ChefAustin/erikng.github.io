Last night I announced that as of [AirWatch 9.1](https://my.air-watch.com/help/9.1/en/Content/Release_Notes/Help_Release_Notes.htm), macadmins now have the ability to begin work on custom MDM.

# Presentation slides
You can find my presentation slides [here](/media/pdf/macbrained_april.pdf)

# Open source tools
I also announced a few open source projects that you might be interested in.

## DEPNotify
DEPNotify is a UI tool for showing your users the status of your DEP enrollment process.

## InstallApplications
InstallApplications is a tool I recently open sourced and blogged about in [Part 5](/2017/04/05/Custom-DEP-Part-5-Dynamic-InstallApplication/) . This works around the limitations of mdmclient/InstallApplication.

# It's an exciting time to be a macadmin
As I said months ago, it's an exciting time to be a macadmin. We now have vendors that are forward thinking and will allow us to have flexible DEP deployments, custom tailored to each company's unique requirements.

## My company is hiring! :smile:
If you're as excited as I am, come join our team.

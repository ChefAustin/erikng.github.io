[I recently took part in the macadmins podcast](http://podcast.macadmins.org/2016/12/28/episode-18-hardware-hacking-in-the-new-era/) and had a great time, but there was one comment that struck a chord with me - [Marcus Ransom](https://twitter.com/marcusransom) thanked me for writing Cacher. Cacher is my most popular github repo and while I get thanked often for creating it, my reaction usually goes something like this:

![Ugh](/images/2017/01/ugh.gif)

:scream: :scream: :scream: :scream: :scream: :scream: :scream: :scream: :scream: :scream:

## Why?
Cacher was originally written to prove to a former boss that both my job and the equipment I had purchased was actually worth the cost. When I thought I had something of actual value I decided to actually upload it and see what other people thought - they liked it. When Apple heard about Cacher, I fully expected them to make a GUI wrapper and finally kill Cacher. That obviously hasn't happened.

I'm really happy people like it...

## But it's written in shell...

...and consistently breaks each time a new iOS/macOS release comes out

...and can't find new iOS devices when they are released

... and can't handle personal iCloud files without having [inaccurate](https://github.com/erikng/Cacher/issues/22) [statistics](https://github.com/erikng/Cacher/issues/12)

... and I don't really have a need for caching servers [at the moment](https://github.com/erikng/Cacher/issues/12#issuecomment-235769494)

...and [in 2015](/2015/09/22/cacher-2-dropping-server-4-support-and-future-plans/) I basically said Cacher was dead and I would be merging my code with Allister's [Sashay](https://github.com/macadmins/sashay).

## ...but I couldn't stop thinking about Marcus' comment
All throughout Christmas break, I kept thinking about how more people would possibly hear about Cacher and be intrigued to download it. Thoughts raced through my head about how I could improve the tool:

> I could add a dynamic key/value store for the iOS devices!
>
> I could add an for DeviceID's!
>
> I could add Slack support!
>
> I could _finally_ add custom date support!
>
> I could remove the need for sudo/root permissions unless it's actually needed!
>
> What if Cacher could setup the Caching service logs?

## ... so I wrote Cacher 3.0 ... in Python!
Here is an example of how I'm using Cacher with Slack: :smile:

### Usage

```python
Usage: Cacher [options]

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --targetdate=TARGETDATE
                        Optional: Date to parse. Example: 2017-01-15.
  --logpath=LOGPATH     Optional: Caching Log Path. Defaults to:
                        /Library/Server/Caching/Logs
  --deviceids           Optional: Use Device IDs (Ex: iPhone7,2). Defaults to:
                        False
  --nostdout            Optional: Do not print to standard out
  --configureserver     Optional: Configure Server to log Client Data
  --serveralert         Optional: Send Server Alert
  --slackalert          Optional: Use Slack
  --slackwebhook=SLACKWEBHOOK
                        Optional: Slack Webhook URL. Requires Slack Option.
  --slackusername=SLACKUSERNAME
                        Optional: Slack username. Defaults to Cacher.Requires
                        Slack Option.
  --slackchannel=SLACKCHANNEL
                        Optional: Slack channel. Can be username or channel
                        Ex. #channel or @username. Requires Slack Option.
```

For more information on how to use these features, please see the official [ReadMe](https://github.com/erikng/Cacher/blob/master/README.md).

## Changes that may impact you.
The biggest things that could impact you are the following:

- Server 5.2 or higher is required
- The server alert is no longer included by default. You must use the `--serveralert` option.

For people that are curious as to why I removed the server alert, it was due to root/sudo permissions. With this being an option, Cacher can now be run as a standard user. I think that's a better approach especially in conjunction with the Slack alerts (which I personally find more helpful than the e-mail alerts.)

## Why didn't you merge with Sashay?

I never merged my code with Allister's for a few reasons:

- The name was terrible (yes, I'm petty)
- I didn't like some of the features and how it different from Cacher.
- It was going to be a significant amount of effort to have two competing tools have the functionality that each one of us envisioned.

## It's finally done.
The Cacher rewrite took a good 3 days to write and it more than likely wouldn't have been possible without Michael Lynn's original [inspiration](https://gist.github.com/pudquick/ffdbdb52ae6960ca8e55).

While there are [things](https://github.com/erikng/Cacher/blob/master/Cacher#L283-L409) I'm not proud of in the current refactor, there are things that I'm [really](https://github.com/erikng/Cacher/blob/master/Cacher#L437-L513) [happy](https://github.com/erikng/Cacher/blob/master/Cacher#L196-L237) [about](https://github.com/erikng/Cacher/blob/master/Cacher#L81-L139). I hope sometime soon I'll have time to refactor this some more and reduce the amount of repeated code.

## Conclusion

While I'm sure there are edge cases to work through, I look forward to people using the new version and giving feedback. Here's to starting off 2017 in a great way.
